# ML_Predict_MLB_Games_Outcome
It is fair to say that the Major League Baseball (MLB) has entered into a new phase ever since the book “Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game” was published in 2003 [1]. Nowadays, it is no longer uncommon but rather a necessity for a baseball team to hire a group of full-time data analysts, also known as “Sabermetricians”, as part of the front office team. They analyse game statistics and players performance; and use the analysis result to augment game decision making that give the team a winning edge. With an average MLB team worth $1.78 billion in 2019 [2], predicting the winner of an MLB season is therefore important to team owners to ensure they are getting value for their investment money. By using publicly available MLB data, this study aims to explore the suitability of implementing deep-learning-based machine learning model to predict MLB game outcome, and hopefully to provide an insight to teams on area where they need to improve on in order to secure more wins in an MLB season.
